## Reference classes 

- https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/R6/vignettes/Introduction.html

> R6 classes are similar to R’s standard reference classes, but are lighter weight, and avoid some issues that come along with using S4 classes (R’s reference classes are based on S4)

- http://adv-r.had.co.nz/R5.html

>There are two main differences between reference classes and S3 and S4:
> -   Refclass objects use message-passing OO
> -   Refclass objects are mutable: the usual R copy on modify semantics do not apply
