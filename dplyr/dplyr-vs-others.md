## dplyr vs. data.table

A short summary by Hadley Jan 2015: https://twitter.com/hadleywickham/status/553169339751215104 (http://stackoverflow.com/a/27840349)

> Most R users work with well under 1 million rows of data, and dplyr is sufficiently fast enough for that size of data that you're not aware of processing time. We optimise dplyr for expressiveness on medium data; feel free to use data.table for raw speed on bigger data.
