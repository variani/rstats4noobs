* [Jacob Bien](http://faculty.bscb.cornell.edu/~bien/): works on problems in statistical machine learning and applied statistics, especially developing methods that might be of direct use to scientists (or others with large datasets). A particular interest of his is in using convex optimization to tackle the challenges of high-dimensional datasets.
